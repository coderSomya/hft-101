# Branch Reduction: Teaching Guide

## What is Branch Reduction?

**Branch reduction** (also known as **branch minimization** or **branch elimination**) is an optimization technique that reduces the number or impact of conditional branches (`if`, `switch`, loops with conditions) in performance-critical code. Modern CPUs rely on **branch prediction** to speculatively execute instructions ahead of time — but when a branch is mispredicted, the pipeline must flush, causing a stall of 10–20 cycles or more.

Branch reduction aims to:
- Eliminate branches entirely (via arithmetic, masking, or lookup tables)
- Make branches more predictable (e.g., sort data before processing)
- Replace branches with conditional moves or predicated instructions

## Why Reduce Branches?

- Avoid **branch misprediction penalties**
- Improve **instruction pipeline efficiency**
- Enable better **auto-vectorization** (SIMD hates branches)
- Improve performance in **tight loops** and **hot paths**
