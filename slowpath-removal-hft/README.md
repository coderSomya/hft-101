# Slowpath Removal: Teaching Guide

## What is Slowpath Removal?

**Slowpath removal** is an optimization technique that minimizes or eliminates the execution of **rarely taken code paths** (called “slowpaths”) in performance-critical sections. The goal is to keep the **hot path** (frequently executed code) as lean, predictable, and cache-efficient as possible.

Slowpaths often handle:
- Error conditions
- Edge cases
- Initialization/fallback logic
- Logging, assertions, or debugging code

By isolating or removing slowpaths from the main execution flow, you improve:
- Instruction cache locality
- Branch prediction accuracy
- Pipeline efficiency
- Compiler optimization opportunities (inlining, vectorization)

## Why Remove Slowpaths?

- **Reduces code size** of hot paths → better I-cache utilization
- **Improves branch prediction** — CPU doesn’t waste resources predicting rare branches
- **Enables aggressive compiler optimizations** on the hot path (e.g., inlining, constant propagation)
- **Reduces register pressure** — compiler doesn’t need to preserve state for rarely used variables
