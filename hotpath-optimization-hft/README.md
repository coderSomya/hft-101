# Hotpath Optimization: Teaching Guide

## What is Hotpath Optimization?

**Hotpath optimization** is the practice of identifying and aggressively optimizing the most frequently executed code paths in a program — the “hot paths.” Unlike slowpath removal (which isolates rare branches), hotpath optimization focuses on **maximizing throughput, minimizing latency, and improving cache efficiency** for the dominant execution flow.

This is where the **80/20 rule** applies: 80% of execution time is often spent in 20% of the code.

## Why Optimize the Hotpath?

- Maximizes return on optimization effort
- Reduces end-to-end latency
- Improves scalability under load
- Enables better use of CPU features: pipelining, SIMD, prefetching, branch prediction

## How to Identify Hotpaths?

- **Profiling**: Use `perf`, `vtune`, `gprof`, or `valgrind --tool=callgrind`
- **Sampling**: Identify functions or loops with highest self-time
- **Tracing**: Instrument code to log entry/exit of critical sections
